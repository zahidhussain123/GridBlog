                        Deserts are areas that receive very little precipitation. 
                        People often use the adjectives “hot,” “dry,” and “empty” to describe deserts,
                         but these words do not tell the whole story. Although some deserts are very hot, 
                         with daytime temperatures as high as 54°C (130°F), other deserts have cold winters 
                         or are cold year-round. And most deserts, far from being empty and lifeless, are home
                          to a variety of plants, animals, and other organisms. People have adapted to life in the 
                          desert for thousands of years

                        Most beach materials are the products of weathering and erosion.
                         Over many years, water and wind wear away at the land.
                          The continual action of waves beating against a rocky cliff, 
                          for example, may cause some rocks to come loose. Huge boulders
                           can be worn town to tiny grains of sand.

                        A mountain is a landform that rises high above its surroundings. 
                        Taller than a hill, it usually has steep slopes and a rounded or
                         sharp peak. Mountains are rarely found alone. Groups of mountains
                          are called ranges. Lines of ranges form mountain belts.Some mountains
                           were formed by the activity of volcanoes. Scientists believe that most 
                           volcanic mountains are made up of rock that melted deep within Earth.
                            The rock rose through Earth’s surface, or crust.

                        Essay on Forest: Forests are rightly called as the lungs of the earth.
                         They are the most important part of our ecosystem and are pivotal in
                          maintaining the balance in the food cycle and the natural equilibrium 
                          on the planet. Forests cover almost 31% of the surface of the earth.
                           They are a habitat for not only wildlife and trees but also to some 
                           of the rarest of rare animals and plants on earth.
                           Man has been using the resources of forests for thousands of years.
                            As much as the forest has provided man with his livelihood, man has not
                             given back to the forest as much as he should have. And this overuse,
                              imbalance and greed of man have led to a disturbance in the
                               natural cycle of the earth.

                        Global electricity consumption will account for more than
                         40% of the total energy demand by the year 2050, with
                          some regions of the world expanding well beyond this level.
                           At the same time, there is a growing urgency to adopt and
                            reach zero carbon emissions to improve air quality and slow 
                            the effects of climate change. As the demand for energy grows,
                             sustainable energy sources are needed to generate electricity
                              that is powered by a sustainable power grid.
